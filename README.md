# Central Authentication Service

## Introduction
Provides authentication as a service. An approach to a service-oriented architecture. Uses Ruby libraries to create a central authentication system that's based on the JASIG's CAS protocol. 
Implements the aforementioned protocol specification. Any client application can consume the server's services.

## CAS
CAS provides single sign-on for the web and attempts to be a comprehensive platform for your authentication and authorization needs.

CAS provides an extensive list of features for most application requirements and integrations, offers community documentation and implementation support, has an extensive community of adopters and is virtually supported by most programming languages, frameworks and products.
